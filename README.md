## My Favorite Movie
---
Probably one of the most popular series over the world is **Transformers.**
As a kid, I was naturally enthusiatic anything about vehicles, especially cars.
When **Pixar's Cars** was released back in 2006, I was already 2 years old and
enjoyed that movie for its material, storyline, and especially the technological
advancement they made for its cinematography that placed the animated film
industry to a whole new level. Then, one time in 2008, my mom and dad gifted me
a film they knew I would surely love. A film about vehicles turning to humanoid
robots from outer space, and I **LOVED** it. That first live-action film of the
series directed by Michael Bay may not have the best story plot of all, but its
cinematography is something this world can never deny. The detail of realism to
make children, old fans, and casual enjoyers alike in the action scenes, and 
*of course,* transformations, is something to be studied.

With that said, as of writing this letter, the franchise has been making a lot
of improvement to not just the visuals, but also to the storyline. I would
recommend to anyone reading this to watch **Transformers ONE** to see the best
this series can get yet. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you!
